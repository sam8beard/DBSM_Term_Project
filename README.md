This is our term project for our database management class. 

In this project, we will be integrating different kinds of queries 
based upon a data set filled with information from previous Olympic 
events. 

## Commands to compile and run: 

1: Construct database from csv files:

``` python database.py ``` 
 
2: Activate virtual environment

``` source ./venv/Scripts/activate  ```

3: Run the application 

``` python -m flask run ```
