### Monday
- [ ] Finish Query Page Styling
- [ ] Finish Queries 2-4
- [ ] Stretch Goal: Routing Functionality with buttons
- [ ] Rewrite the database code so you call it once and it creates everything
- [ ] Alternatively: We have a separate python file called "build db" that will build our
database and load all our tables in, and then in our flask app, we just have code to make a connection our db
so that we don't have to rewrite our database tables everytime and we can have cursor (what we use to interact
with the db) just in the flask app. --> We need to have 2 python scripts activate to run our code (make sure to
document this in the readme)
